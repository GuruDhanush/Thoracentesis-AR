# Thoracentesis-AR
An AR helper to perform Thoracentesis. 


## Introduction

Thoracentesis is an invasive procedure to remove fluid or air from the pleural space for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. A cannula, or hollow needle, is carefully introduced into the thorax, generally after administration of local anesthesia. The procedure is typically done while the patient is sitting. The fluid from the pleural cavity is aspirated via a three-way tap. 


## Deployment Instructions

All the necessary files to be hosted are kept in the dist folder. They are deployed [here](https://gurudhanush.github.io/Thoracentesis-AR/).

### steps
